# 🍱 Food Waste Identification using Deep Learning

A smart and sustainable solution for detecting food waste through image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project helps in promoting responsible consumption and reducing waste.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Food waste is a global issue with major environmental and economic consequences. This project leverages Deep Learning techniques to identify food waste from images. The primary goal is to:

- Detect spoiled vs. fresh food from image data
- Classify the type of food (vegetables, fruits, cooked, uncooked)
- Assist organizations or individuals in managing food donations or disposal smartly

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- 📊 NumPy, Pandas
- 📷 OpenCV
- 🔍 Scikit-learn
- 🧠 TensorFlow / Keras (CNN Model)
- 📉 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- 💻 Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Images of various food items: fresh, spoiled, cooked, leftover
   - Dataset curated and labeled for training

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Resizing, normalization, and augmentation
   - Splitting into train/test/validation sets

3. **Model Building**:
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras
   - Activation: ReLU, Softmax
   - Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

4. **Training & Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy and loss tracking
   - Confusion Matrix and Precision/Recall metrics

5. **Prediction**:
   - Upload or capture image
   - Model classifies it into relevant category
