## 📌 Project Overview

Every year, millions of tons of food go to waste. This project aims to **predict potential food waste** using real or simulated data, allowing better planning and reduction of waste.

### ✨ Key Highlights:
- End-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline**
- Clean and modular **Python scripts**
- Trained model saved and reused for **real-time predictions**
- Easily extendable and ready for deployment

## 🔍 What This Project Includes

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `train_model.py` | Preprocesses the data, trains the model, and saves it as a `.pkl` file |
| `predict_food_waste.py` | Loads the saved model and makes predictions based on new data |
| `requirements.txt` | All required dependencies |
| `.gitignore` | Prevents uploading unnecessary files (cache, virtual env, etc.) |
| `README.md` | You’re reading it! 🎉 |
